# Synapse: AI-Driven Networking CRM 🚀

> **6th USC Marshall AI Case Competition - Finalist (Top 6 out of 33 Teams)** > *Developed by Team A4ever*

## 📖 Project Overview
**Synapse** is an AI-powered personal relationship management (PRM) tool designed specifically for students and professionals to manage networking connections effectively. 

Born out of the need to solve the "Handshake to Hire" gap, Synapse leverages **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to transform fragmented conversation notes into organized, actionable insights, helping users build genuine connections rather than just collecting contacts.

## ⚠️ The Problem
Through user research and surveys (N=100+ students), we identified critical pain points in the networking process:
* **Information Overload:** 75% of students forget conversation details shortly after networking events.
* **Fragmented Data:** Contact details and context are scattered across LinkedIn, emails, physical notes, and spreadsheets.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Lack of timely follow-ups leads to connections going "cold."
* **Generic Outreach:** "Copy-paste" thank-you notes fail to leave a lasting impression.

## 💡 The Solution
Synapse acts as an intelligent layer between your networking events and your professional network.

### Key Features
* **🎙️ Smart Capture & Auto-Sort:**
    * Multi-modal input (Voice Memos, Text, Business Card Scan).
    * Automatically extracts names, roles, and key conversation topics.
* **🧠 NLP Summarization:**
    * Summarizes lengthy conversation notes into 3-4 key highlights.
    * Identifies actionable "hooks" for future conversation.
* **✉️ AI Follow-Up Drafts:**
    * Generates personalized follow-up email drafts based on specific conversation context (not generic templates).
    * Tone adjustment ensuring messages sound professional yet authentic.
* **📅 Intelligent Pipeline:**
    * Dashboard view of connection status (New, Follow-up Needed, Connected).
    * Automated reminders to prevent connections from slipping through the cracks.
* **🔒 Privacy-First Architecture:**
    * Local-first storage encryption.
    * User-controlled data opt-in (no background recording).

## 🛠️ System Design & Methodology
* **Data Pipeline:** Unstructured Data (Voice/Text) → Pre-processing → Entity Extraction (NER) → Summarization Model → Structured Database.
* **Models:** Utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding and content generation.
* **User Experience:** Designed with a "Low-Friction" philosophy to ensure data capture takes <3 minutes post-event.
